# `tinysh` 🐚

A very very VERY simple shell program. I'm building this as part of the ["Build Your Own Shell"](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) [codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io) challenge.

As always, this builds with `nix`, so to get up and running:

```nix
nix run github:yoquec/tinysh
```
